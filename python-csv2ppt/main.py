Sean Scully, October 2024

"main.py" - csv2pptx.py
program to generate pptxs from simple csv data files
aligns bullet points according to spaces before each word in the cell
generate generic powerpoint we can style afterward.

Goals:
standardize powerpoints
make new powerpoint generation easier
focus more on content, organization, and accessibility than wrangling slides

Future:
Done-add dosis-semibold for font
-test functionality of image slides addition
    -pull title of image slide from a separate csv
    -expand to pull from a folder of image files and a master slide title csv
-expand to read a folder of data files and output multiple pptx
-utilize filename for title slide "title.text ="
-build prompt for autogenerating the csv, with all the commas and spaces, or auto-format sample text
    -intermediary files?

Instead of directly assigning p.level = level, we adjust it with p.level = max(0, level - 1). This means:

    If the bullet point has no leading spaces (indicating it's a top-level bullet), level would be 0, so after subtracting 1, it remains 0.
    For sub-bullets with one leading space, this results in p.level = 0 for the first level, p.level = 1 for the second level, and so forth, correctly starting bullet levels from 0 instead of 1.

"""


    CSV Format: Sub-bullets are indicated by leading spaces in the CSV. You can adjust how many spaces represent different bullet levels based on your preference.

    Determining Levels: The bullet level is determined by counting leading spaces in bullet.count(" "). The bullet text is extracted by stripping these spaces using bullet.strip().

    Simplified Bullet Handling: This approach reduces the need for complex parsing and more easily aligns with how you might visually represent content in a slide.

Benefits of This Approach:

    Simplicity: Itâ€™s easier to modify the CSV by simply adding spaces for sub-bullets, making it more visually understandable.
    Maintainability: There's less code complexity in determining levels, which aids in debugging.
    Flexibility: You can easily adjust the presentation structure just by modifying the CSV without changing code logic.

This should help avoid issues with data parsing and bullet point creation.
